Drag and drop is fully implemented and scrabble can be at least partially played.
The main feature missing is support for blank tiles. An attempt was made (and is commented out), but is largely buggy.
I overlooked one of the requirements and as a result the game does allow blanks between letters, but the algorithm accounts for this and does not submit.
There are currently not warning errors for the user.
